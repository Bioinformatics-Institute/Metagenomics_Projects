This is a repository for all the metagenomics scripts / analysis routines that are performed.
Place generic scripts in the base directory. If there are any special / specific analyses that were performed then make a subfolder with the project number and add them in there.
It may also be a good idea to include a file detailing the steps / scripts used in order.
